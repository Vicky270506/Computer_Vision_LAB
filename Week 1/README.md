# RGB to Grayscale, Histogram Equalization & Image Resizing (Manual Implementation)

## Objective
Manually implement:
- RGB to Grayscale conversion
- Histogram Equalization
- Image Resizing (using nearest-neighbor or bilinear interpolation)

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Highlights
- No use of OpenCV built-in functions for the operations
- Manual pixel-wise computation

## How to Run
Open `01_grayscale_histogram_resize.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
