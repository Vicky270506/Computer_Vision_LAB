# Computer_Vision_LAB
This repository contains weekly Computer Vision lab experiments completed as part of my university curriculum. Each experiment is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using manual methods for traditional techniques such as image filtering, edge detection, segmentation, and object tracking.
